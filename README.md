## What is this repo or project?
This web app is built using React.js and has a UI that's broken up into components, has managed component states and responds to user events.

## How does it work?
A user clicks on an image and earns a point. As long as the user proceeds to click a different image, their score will increase and a message saying, "You Guessed Correct" appears. Once a user clicks on the same image twice a message saying, "You Guessed Wrong" appears at the top of the screen and the score is reset to 0.

1. A user clicks on any image to begin. Their score will increase by +1.

2. Each image is listening for click events and once an image is clicked, all of the images will randomly reposition themselves on the screen.

3. To continue advancing their score, the user must continue to click a different image with each click. When the user clicks on an image that they have already clicked, their score is reset to 0 and the message, "You Guessed Wrong" appears at the top of the screen.

## Who will use this repo or project?

## What is the goal of this project?
